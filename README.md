# Comp-3016-CW1
### Software used:
Visual studio 2022 and windows 10 was used to create the project

### How to play
The goal of the game is to defeat all the enmies on the map.
- W to move up
- S to move down
- A to move left
- D to move right

To start a fight with an enemy just move so that you are colliding with the enemy. When in combat decide which move to do by typing the name of the move followed by enter. The name isn't case sensitive however you do need to type it with the same spelling as is shown.

### Exception handling
Within the game there are many places where null checks are used to ensure that null instances aren't used as an object. There is also some error handling with the file reading as if the map file is not found then the game doesn't try to continue further
